[00:08.79] Sometimes I get to feelin'
[00:11.23] I was back in the old days, long ago
[00:17.47] When we were kids, when we were young
[00:20.26] Things seemed so perfect, you know
[00:25.85] The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
[00:30.13] The sun was always shinin'
[00:32.05] We just lived for fun
[00:42.55] 
[00:34.24] Sometimes it seems like lately
[00:36.90] I just don't know
[00:38.76] The rest of my life's been just a show
[00:57.76] 
[00:46.97] Those were the days of our lives
[00:55.21] The bad things in life were so few
[01:03.58] Those days are all gone now, but one thing is true
[01:12.26] When I look, and I find, I still love you
[01:32.76] 
[01:19.21] You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
[01:24.53] Ain't that a shame
[01:27.01] Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
[01:32.97] When life was just a game
[01:36.39] No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
[01:40.59] When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
[02:06.59] 
[01:44.99] Sometimes it seems like lately
[01:47.52] I just don't know
[01:49.83] Better sit back and go with the flow
[02:07.83] 
[01:57.18] 'Cause these are the days of our lives
[02:05.65] They've flown in the swiftness of time
[02:24.65] 
[02:14.24] These days are all gone now, but some things remain
[02:22.60] When I look, and I find, no change
[02:39.60] 
[03:12.09] Those were the days of our lives, yeah
[03:20.42] The bad things in life were so few
[03:28.58] Those days are all gone now, but one thing's still true
[03:37.35] When I look, and I find
[03:41.92] I still love you
[03:49.92] 
[03:43.41] I still love you
